## Lab Objectives

	#The goal of cluster analysis is to classify objects such as species, habitats, or environmental 
		#variables, into clusters based on their similarities or dissimilarities. This allows ecologists 
		#to identify natural groupings and patterns within ecological data. Divisive hierarchical clustering 
		#starts with all objects in the same cluster and iteratively divides them into different clusters. 
		#Non-hierarchical clustering identifies clusters formed at the threshold of similarity without taking 
		#into account the hierarchical cluster structure. In this lab, we will learn to:

		#-   Use a divisive hierarchical clustering approach to identify clusters in environmental and 
			#species data.
		#-   Apply K-means partitioning to ecological data and recognize the advantages and disadvantages of 
			#this approach relative to hierarchical approaches.
		#-   Use indicator species analysis to identify species that are strongly associated with pre-determined 
			#site groups.

## Setting up the R Workspace and Preparing the Data

	#We will load the necessary packages and prepare the dataset as we have done previously. This time I'm 
		#hiding most of the code because you should know what to do by now.

	#First load the necessary packages and data:

		library(vegan)
		library(dplyr)
		library(ggplot2)
		library(cluster)
		library(indicspecies)

		#source("C:\\USGS_OCRU\\Teaching\\FW599_Multivariate_Statistics\\Data\\Biostats.R")
    setwd("C:/Users/jasmi/OneDrive/Documents/Academic/OSU/Git/multivariate-analysis")
    source("Biostats.R")
    source("coldiss.R")

  		dat <- read.csv("Harney_Fishes_2007.csv", row.names = 1)
	
  		sub_dat <- subset(dat, SMU=="Malheur")

	#We will once again subset the data to include only the Malheur sites since the entire dataset is too large 
		#to effectively visualize.

  		spp_N <- colSums(sub_dat[,16:ncol(sub_dat)])
  		spp_0 <- subset(spp_N, spp_N == 0)
  		omit <- names(spp_0)

  		dat2 <- sub_dat[,!(colnames(sub_dat) %in% omit)]
	
  		dat3 <- dat2[rowSums(dat2[,16:ncol(dat2)]) >0, ]
  
  		dat3$Herbaceous[is.na(dat3$Herbaceous)] <- 0 
  		dat3$Ann_Herb[is.na(dat3$Ann_Herb)] <- 0
	
  		dat3 <- dat3[complete.cases(dat3$SiteLength),]
  
  		dat_final <- dat3
	
  		fish <- dat_final[,16:ncol(dat_final)]
  		env <- dat_final[,1:15]
	
  		fish_red <- drop.var(fish, min.fo=1)
  
  		fish_dens <- fish_red
  		for(i in 1:nrow(fish_red)){	
    			fish_dens[i,] <- fish_red[i,]/env$SiteLength[i]
    			}
  
  		drop <- c("Latitude","Longitude","SiteLength","SiteWidth","SurfaceArea")
  		env <- env[,!(colnames(env) %in% drop)]
  		env_cont <- env[,!(colnames(env) %in% c("SMU","Pop","NLCD_Cat"))]
  
  		env <- env[,!(colnames(env) %in% c("Ave_Max_D","Ann_Herb"))]
  		env_cont <- env_cont[,!(colnames(env_cont) %in% c("Ave_Max_D","Ann_Herb"))]
	
  		log_fish_abu <- log(fish_red + 1)
  		log_fish_dens <- log(fish_dens + 1)

  		env_std <- decostand(env_cont, "max")	

## Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (Divisive Analysis, or DIANA)

	#As for agglomerative hierarchical clustering, the first step is to produce an association matrix. 
		#We've already determined that, for the species abundance data, the Bray-Curtis matrix is a good choice.

  		fish.bray <- vegdist(log_fish_dens, "bray")

	#The clustering algorithm is carried out in R using the `diana` function.

  		diana_fish <- diana(as.dist(fish.bray))

	#Note that DIANA can also be carried out using the log-transformed abundance data with the code: 
		#`diana_fish <- diana(log_fish_dens)`. This, may be advisable for very large datasets, where a 
		#distance matrix will be substantially larger than the data matrix, thus requiring more computing power.

	#The cophenetic correlation coefficient can be calculated for a divisive analysis the same way it's 
		#calculated 
		#for an agglomerative analysis. Remember that values range from 0 â€“ 1, where a value closer to 1 
			#indicates a solution of high quality. How does this solution compare to our agglomerative solution(s)?

  		hclus.cophenetic(fish.bray, diana_fish)

	#We can also use an elbow plot to examine the optimal number of clusters in the same way as for agglomerative 
		#clustering.

  		hclus.scree(diana_fish)

	#In this case, it looks like there's a bit of a natural break around five clusters, which makes sense when 
		#we visually assess the dendrogram.

  		plot(diana_fish, which=2, main="DIANA Dendrogram", 
			xlab="Sites", 
			ylab="Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity", 
			hang=-1)
			rect.hclust(diana_fish, k=5)

		fishcl.class <- cutree(diana_fish, k=5)

		fish_dat_new <- cbind(fishcl.class, log_fish_dens)
			par(mfrow=c(3,3))
			box.plots(fish_dat_new, by="fishcl.class")

  		plot(log_fish_dens$TROUT_RB, log_fish_dens$DACE_UNID, 
			col = fishcl.class, 
			pch = 19, 
    			main = "DIANA Clustering with 5 Clusters", 
			xlab="Redband trout", 
			ylab="Dace")

## K-Means Partitioning

	#K-means partitioning or clustering is a non-hierarchical method used to partition data into k clusters by 
		#minimizing within-cluster sum of squares error.

	#The desired number of clusters must be set a-priori by the user. Based on our previous analyses, we can 
		#guess that somewhere between 4-6 clusters is optimal for this dataset. If we're still unsure, we can 
		#examine an elbow plot and silhouette width plot te get a better sense for the optimal number of clusters.
      dev.off()
  		nhclus.scree(fish.bray, max.k = 20)

	#The Calinski-Harabasz (CH) Index, or the ratio of between-cluster separation to within-cluster dispersion 
		#normalized by their degrees of freedom, is another way to determine the optimal number of clusters. A 
		#higher CH value indicates better clustering.

		fishcl.kmeans.cas <- cascadeKM(fish.bray, inf.gr=2, sup.gr=10, iter=100)
		plot(fishcl.kmeans.cas, sortg=T)
		fishcl.kmeans.cas$results

	#It looks like CH is maximized at four clusters.

	#As for DIANA, K-means clustering can be performed either on the distance matrices or the raw data. 
		#For species abundances, it's best practice to use the distance matrix.

		fish.kmeans <- kmeans(fish.bray, centers=4, iter.max=10000, nstart=10)
		fish.kmeans

  		plot(log_fish_dens$TROUT_RB, log_fish_dens$DACE_UNID, 
			col = fish.kmeans$cluster, 
			pch = 19, 
  			main = "K-Means Clustering with 4 Clusters", 
			xlab="Redband trout", 
			ylab="Dace")

  		
  		
#Because we'll have to provide pre-determined site groupings for indicator species analysis below, 
		#let's examine clusters in the environmental data as well.

  		env.euc <- vegdist(env_std, metric="euclidean")

		envcl.kmeans.cas <- cascadeKM(env.euc, inf.gr=2, sup.gr=10, iter=100)
		plot(envcl.kmeans.cas, sortg=T)
		envcl.kmeans.cas$results

		env.kmeans <- kmeans(env.euc, centers=4, iter.max=10000, nstart=10)
		env.kmeans
	
		env.class <- env.kmeans$cluster
		env_dat_new<-cbind(env.class, env_std)
		par(mfrow=c(2,3))
		box.plots(env_dat_new, by="env.class")

	
		#In general, the sites split well by habitat type (shrub-scrub vs. forest), elevation, and gradient. 
		#If you remember, K-Means output is random depending on starting centroids. If we want consistent 
		#groupings, we can use agglomerative clustering to select sites.

## Indicator Species Analysis

	#Indicator species analysis is a very fun way to identify species that are strongly associated with 
		#specific groups of sites or environmental conditions. It is best used when you have *a priori* 
		#information about sites and are interested in identifying species associated with different systems, 
		#strata, treatment groups, etc.

	#Let's try applying indicator species analysis on different populations (watersheds) within the Malheur basin first.

 		site_num <- env$Pop
  		ind_sp <- multipatt(log_fish_dens, site_num, func = "IndVal.g", control = how(nperm=999))
  		summary(ind_sp)

	#The analysis did not find any indicator species across populations. From this we can infer that there are 
		#likely similar habitat conditions driving species abundances across watersheds. What if we try the analysis 
		#using NLCD land cover categories?

  		site_num <- env$NLCD_Cat
  		ind_sp <- multipatt(log_fish_dens, site_num, func = "IndVal.g", control = how(nperm=999))
  		summary(ind_sp)

	#Now we can see that redside shiner are associated with herbaceous and wetland habitats, but the indicator 
		#species analysis didn't really tell us much else. What if we use the analysis on sites that have been 
		#clustered into groups based on their full suite of environmental characteristics?

	#This takes a little bit more work, but we already know how to cluster. Lucky us!

		envcl.ward <- hclust(env.euc, method = "ward.D")

	#Now we can see that sucker are significantly associated with high depth, low gradient, and low canopy cover sites, 
		#while dace are significantly associated with low gradient, low elevation sites. Although these sites may be 
		#scattered throughout the Malheur Basin, we get a better sense for species associations with specific
